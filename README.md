Computational Thinking (4 Pillars)
•	Decomposition
o	Break down steps: parse input → sort → initialize low/high → compute mid → compare → update range.
•	Pattern Recognition
o	Binary search repeatedly halves the search range.
o	Works only on a sorted list.
•	Abstraction
o	Focus only on index positions (low, mid, high) and the target value.
•	Algorithm Design
o	Implement binary search with step-by-step visualization and Markdown formatting.
